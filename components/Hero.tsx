        I recently completed my Master of Information Technology at the University of
        Western Australia. I work across software engineering, data systems, and cloud
        technologies, with a focus on building solutions that are maintainable,
        observable, and reliable in real environments.
        </p>

        <p className="text-muted" style={{ marginTop: "0.75rem" }}>
          I have hands-on experience delivering full-stack and backend systems, including
          optimisation-based trading bots in Python, a PostgreSQL/Power BI data warehouse
          for WA traffic fatality analysis, and an IoT smart garden system using ESP32,
          Python, Flask, and React. I enjoy breaking complex problems into clear and
          testable components.
        </p>

          <p className="text-muted" style={{ marginTop: "0.75rem" }}>
          My technical background spans Python, TypeScript/JavaScript, React, SQL
          databases, FastAPI, Git, Docker, cloud deployment workflows, and open-source
          tools such as Mitmproxy, LiteLLM, and Langfuse. I work independently, document
          decisions, communicate clearly, and support cross-functional teams.

            I am ready to contribute from day one and am actively seeking Junior /
            Graduate Software Engineering roles where I can build real products, solve
            practical problems, and continue growing as an engineer.
