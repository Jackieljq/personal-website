          I recently completed my Master of Information Technology at the
          University of Western Australia. I enjoy working at the intersection of
          software engineering, data, and cloud—designing systems that are
          well-structured, observable, and maintainable.

          My recent work includes building optimisation-based trading bots for
          Bitcoin, designing a WA traffic fatality data warehouse in PostgreSQL
          and Power BI, and developing an IoT smart garden system with ESP32,
          Python, and a React dashboard. I like taking complex ideas and breaking
          them down into small, testable steps.
        </p>
        <p className="text-muted" style={{ marginTop: "0.75rem" }}>
          I am detail-oriented, proactive, and comfortable working both
          independently and with cross-functional teams. I enjoy clear
          communication, documenting decisions, and iterating based on feedback.
          I am currently looking for Junior / Graduate software engineering roles
          where I can keep learning and contribute to real products.
