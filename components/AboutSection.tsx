          I recently completed my Master of Information Technology at the
          University of Western Australia. My experience spans Python,
          TypeScript, React, data engineering, and cloud deployment. I enjoy
          working on projects where I can combine solid engineering practice
          with clear, structured thinking – from designing data pipelines and
          optimisation algorithms to building full-stack applications.

          I am detail-oriented, proactive, and comfortable collaborating with
          both technical and non-technical stakeholders. I like breaking down
          problems, testing ideas with small experiments, and iterating towards
          robust solutions.
