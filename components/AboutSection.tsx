          I recently completed my Master of Information Technology at the
          University of Western Australia. My experience spans Python, TypeScript,
          React, data engineering, and cloud deployment. I enjoy working on
          projects where I can combine solid engineering practice with clear,
          structured thinking – from designing data pipelines and optimisation
          algorithms to building full-stack applications.

          I am detail-oriented, proactive, and comfortable collaborating with both
          technical and non-technical stakeholders. I like breaking down problems,
          testing ideas with small experiments, and iterating towards robust
          solutions.
